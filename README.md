# New Paragraph on Enter

This plugin automatically inserts a double newline when you press the Enter key, making it easier to create paragraphs while typing.

## Why does this exist?

I like to write in stories and was used to hitting the enter key once to create a new paragraph. I refused to change my habits, so I created this plugin to make it easier to create paragraphs while typing.

## How it works

Hitting enter now inserts two lines to create a new paragraph.

Technically, the plugin checks if you are in a list, task, table, or code block. If you are not in one of these special contexts, it will insert two newlines instead of one.
